      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel the Irish potatoes and cut them into small cubes.</li>
      <li>Rinse the potato cubes under cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, add water and bring it to a boil. Add the potato cubes
        and cook for about 10-15 minutes or until they are tender.
      </li>
      <li>Drain the cooked potatoes and set them aside.</li>
      <li>In a separate pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped onions and minced garlic to the pan. Sauté until the
        onions are translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced tomatoes and green bell pepper to the pan. Stir and cook
        for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked potato cubes to the pan and mix them with the sautéed
        vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with paprika, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Stir well to coat the
        potatoes and vegetables with the spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the potatoes simmer for
        about 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and serve the Rwandan Irish Potatoes while hot.</li>
    </ol>
