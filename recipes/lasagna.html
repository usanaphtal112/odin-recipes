      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium
        heat until the meat is browned and the onion is softened. Drain any
        excess fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, basil, oregano,
        salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce
        the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
        dish. Place 4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon about a third of the sauce over the noodles, followed by a third
        of the mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and ricotta cheese. Repeat
        this layering two more times, ending with a layer of sauce and cheese on
        top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven
        for 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the
        cheese is melted and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
        Garnish with fresh basil leaves.
      </li>
      <li>Slice and serve the lasagna, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
